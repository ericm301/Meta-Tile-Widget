I'm modifying diceroll123's hard work, here, mainly to preset my own selected defaults for the widget.
For now, I will assume that anyone reading this is familiar with ANTP and the original Meta-Tile-Widget

Changes, so far:
* Merge dev into master.
* Added README.md
* Edited /js/meta-tile.js to set
  * default grid size to 1/9
  * default link to open in newtab
  * Presets for tiles to match my standard layout.

How I managed to get them all to work on the first try? I have no idea.
